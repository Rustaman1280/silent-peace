# Collision & Animation Update

## üé¨ Animal Animation System
**Added:** Automatic animation playback for animals

### Features:
- **Auto-detect AnimationPlayer** from FBX models
- **3 Animation States**:
  - üö∂ **Walk** - When wandering around
  - üèÉ **Run** - When fleeing from player
  - üßç **Idle** - When standing still

### How It Works:
```gdscript
play_animation(anim_name: String)
- Tries multiple name variations (Walk, walk, WALK)
- Only changes if different from current animation
- Automatically loops animations
```

### Animation States:
- **Wander** ‚Üí Plays "Walk" animation
- **Flee** ‚Üí Plays "Run" animation
- **Idle** ‚Üí Plays "Idle" animation

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Rabbit.gd` - Added animation control
- `Assets/Scripts/WorldManager.gd` - Added AnimationPlayer detection

## üöß Collision System Upgrade
**Fixed:** Objects are now solid and cannot be walked through

### 1. Tree Collision
**Before:** Trees were Node3D (no physics)
**After:** Trees are StaticBody3D with collision

**Collision Shape:**
- Type: CylinderShape3D (trunk)
- Radius: 0.5m (scales with tree size)
- Height: 8m (scales with tree size)
- Center: 4m above ground

**Result:** ‚úÖ Player cannot walk through trees

---

### 2. Hill Collision
**Before:** Hills were MeshInstance3D (visual only)
**After:** Hills are StaticBody3D with collision

**Collision Shape:**
- Type: SphereShape3D
- Radius: 8-15m (matches hill size)
- Scale: (1, 0.4, 1) - flattened like hill
- Position: Aligned with hill bottom

**Result:** ‚úÖ Player can walk ON hills and cannot go through them

---

### 3. Animal Collision
**Already Working:**
- Type: CharacterBody3D (physics-enabled)
- Collision Shape: CapsuleShape3D
- Solid: Yes, player collides with animals
- Animals collide with trees and hills

**Result:** ‚úÖ Animals are solid objects

## üéØ Technical Implementation

### WorldManager.gd Changes:

#### create_real_tree():
```gdscript
- Return type: Node3D ‚Üí StaticBody3D
+ Added CylinderShape3D collision
+ Scales collision with tree size
+ Positioned at tree center
```

#### create_hill():
```gdscript
- Return type: MeshInstance3D ‚Üí StaticBody3D
+ Added SphereShape3D collision
+ Matches hill shape and scale
+ Allows walking on surface
```

#### create_real_animal():
```gdscript
+ find_animation_player() - Recursive search
+ Store AnimationPlayer in metadata
+ Auto-play initial animation
```

### Rabbit.gd Changes:

#### New Variables:
```gdscript
+ animation_player: AnimationPlayer = null
```

#### New Functions:
```gdscript
+ play_animation(anim_name: String)
  - Checks multiple name variations
  - Prevents re-playing same animation
  - Handles missing animations gracefully
```

#### Updated Functions:
```gdscript
handle_wander() + play_animation("Walk")
handle_flee()   + play_animation("Run")
handle_idle()   + play_animation("Idle")
```

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

### Player Experience:
1. **Trees block movement** - Must navigate around forest
2. **Hills are climbable** - Can walk up slopes
3. **Animals are animated** - More lifelike behavior
4. **No more ghosting** - All objects feel solid

### Performance:
- Collision shapes are simple (cylinder/sphere/capsule)
- No mesh collision (would be too expensive)
- Minimal performance impact

---

## üìù Animation Compatibility

### Supported Animation Names:
The system checks for these variations:
- "Walk" / "walk" / "WALK"
- "Run" / "run" / "RUN"
- "Idle" / "idle" / "IDLE"

### FBX Models:
- Fox.fbx ‚úì
- Deer.fbx ‚úì
- Husky.fbx ‚úì
- ShibaInu.fbx ‚úì
- Stag.fbx ‚úì

If animation not found, animal still works (just no animation).

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Trees:
- [x] Cannot walk through trees
- [x] Trees block player movement
- [x] Trees have visible collision

### Hills:
- [x] Can walk up hills
- [x] Cannot pass through hills
- [x] Hills have proper collision shape

### Animals:
- [x] Animals play walk animation when moving
- [x] Animals play run animation when fleeing
- [x] Animals play idle animation when stopped
- [x] Animals don't walk through trees/hills

---

## üîß Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. Add more animation states (eating, looking around)
2. Add sound effects for animal movement
3. Optimize collision shapes for complex tree models
4. Add ragdoll physics for dead animals
5. Add LOD (Level of Detail) for distant objects
