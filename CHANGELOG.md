### 📝 Notes

This is a **template/framework** for an open-world forest game. All core systems are functional with placeholder graphics. The game is designed to be modular and easily extended.

**Next Steps for Users:**
1. Download free 3D assets (see ASSETS_NEEDED.md)
2. Import assets into project
3. Assets auto-detected by AssetLoader
4. Enjoy HD visuals!

### 🐛 Known Issues
