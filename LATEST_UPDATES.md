# Latest Updates - Silent Peace Forest Game

## 🌿 Grass System Upgrade
**Changed:** Grass generation from placeholder to real 3D models

### Before:
- Simple green quads (5000 blades) using MultiMesh
- Basic placeholder graphics

### After:
- **Real Grass Models**: Uses `Grass.gltf` from Props folder
- **3000 grass clumps** with realistic 3D mesh
- Random rotation and scale variation (0.6-1.2x)
- All placed at ground level (Y=0)
- Falls back to placeholder if model not found

**File Modified:** `Assets/Scripts/GrassGenerator.gd`

## 🦊 Animal Variety System
**Changed:** Single deer type to multiple animal species with better sizing

### Before:
- Only Deer/Stag models
- 20 animals total
- Default size (too large)

### After:
- **5 Animal Types**:
  - 🦊 Fox
  - 🦌 Deer
  - 🐕 Shiba Inu
  - 🐺 Husky
  - 🦌 Stag
- **40 animals total** (doubled for variety)
- **Scaled down to 30-50%** of original size (much more realistic)
- Random animal type for each spawn
- All animals use AI behavior from Rabbit.gd script

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/AssetLoader.gd` - Added `load_animal_models()` function
- `Assets/Scripts/WorldManager.gd` - Updated animal spawning system

## 🎯 Technical Details

### GrassGenerator.gd Changes:
```gdscript
- grass_density: 5000 → 3000 (optimized for 3D models)
- Added: grass_model loading from Grass.gltf
- Added: generate_placeholder_grass() fallback
- Improved: Individual grass instances with proper transforms
```

### AssetLoader.gd Changes:
```gdscript
+ load_animal_models() -> Array[PackedScene]
  - Loads: Fox, Deer, ShibaInu, Husky, Stag
  - Auto-detects available models
  - Returns array of all found animals
```

### WorldManager.gd Changes:
```gdscript
- rabbit_count: 20 → animal_count: 40
+ animal_models: Array[PackedScene]
- create_real_animal(model) → create_real_animal()
  - Picks random model from array
  - Scales down to 0.3-0.5x (30-50% size)
  - Adjusts collision shapes accordingly
```

## 📝 Notes

### Performance:
- Grass reduced from 5000 to 3000 for better performance with 3D models
- Animals use LOD from FBX imports
- MultiMesh not used for grass anymore (individual instances for variety)

### Asset Dependencies:
- Requires: `Assets/Models/Props/Grass.gltf`
- Requires: Animal models in `Assets/Models/Animals/`
- Falls back gracefully if assets missing

### Next Steps:
- Test performance with 3000 grass instances
- May need LOD system if FPS drops
- Consider adding more animal behaviors
